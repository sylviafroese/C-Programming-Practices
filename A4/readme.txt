A note to the marker:
---------------------

I believe that the InsertObject function is working. This was verified by putting printf statements
to print the contents of id1, id2 and id3 in the main method of main0.c.  
However I believe the Retrieve Object is not working and is thus the cause of the segmentation 
fault. I was unable to figure out how to make the Retrieve Object work after trying several 
algorithms.  
Please note, I did not have time to write the Compact() function code due to trying to debug the 
RetrieveObject function.
The Makefile does work and can be used to make the program. 
I also did my best to comment as much as I had time for. I tried my best. This was a hard assignment.
